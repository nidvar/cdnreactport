                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>University graduate in Science, majoring in Physics and Nanotechnology. Dabbled with HTML/CSS/PHP as a hobbie then focused heavily on JavaScript. Now a JavaScript developer working with React and Node.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>My Apps</h3>
                <p>Confident building apps with vanilla JS, followed by ReactJS. Experienced with Node JS, but main focus has been client side.</p>
                <p>Most ReactJS apps on this portfolio use React/Babel CDN, with a few exceptions using create-react-app. Apps that are purely JS with no libraries use Webpack and Babel.</p>
